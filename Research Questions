1. Will any kind of regularisation help us see gradual changes on mmaps, rather than stripes?

2. Will a different batch size help us see these gradual changes?

3. Why doesn't introducing a new class distort the NN?
   Is it because of the huge 1st gradient step?
   Is it because the capacity of the net is too big and we overfit?

4. What happens if we never see the first class (e.g. 0) ever again after the first set of batches?
